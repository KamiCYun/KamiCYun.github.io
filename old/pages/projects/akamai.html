            Akamai Technologies is a company focused on content delivery and cyber security. One of their many cyber security related products is their Bot Manager security system, a highly complicated web script that allowed for websites to distinguish between humans and robots. During the development of the VestaAIO Sneaker Bot, Footlocker, the website the bot primarily operated on, was using this product to protect their checkout flow and various other aspects of the website.
              <p>In order for the bot to be functional, a peer and I reverse engineered the security system and created a solution. Solving Akamai's Bot Manager can be divided into four main steps:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Deobfuscation</li>
                <li>Browser Fingerprinting</li>
                <li>Mouse Movements</li>
                <li>TLS Fingerprinting</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Deobfuscation was by far the easiest step of the process. Akamai used a relatively simple version of obfuscation involving encoding strings and array obfuscation. There were plenty of preexisting resources that were able to deobfuscate the script.</p>
              <p>The next step was to spoof a human-like browser fingerprint. The Akamai script took a wide range of values to generate a comprehensive fingerprint, these values included user agents, browser dimensions, canvas fingerprints, time to execute arithmetic, and much more. In addition to this, they denied access to anyone who used the same browser fingerprint in rapid succession. To combat this, we sandboxed a modified version of the Akamai script and collected annonymous browser fingerprints from friends and anyone willing to assist. From this, we were able to create a program capable of generating thousands of artificial, unique fingerprints derived from the real fingerprints that were harvested.</p>
              <p>In addition to the browser fingerprint, Akamai also collected mouse movements as part of their payload. These mouse movements are judged by a serverside machine learning model that is able to distinguish humans from bots. In response, we developed an algorithm that utilizes a formula called bezier curves to create a smooth human-like curve. We had planned to create our own machine learning model to generate mouse movements, but unfortunately never got around to doing so.</p>
              <p>The final step to solving Akamai's Bot Manager was sending the collected data through a POST request to their verification API. In order for this request to even be processed, it had to have a human-like TLS ClientHello and use HTTP2. Unfortunately for us, the requests library we had been using in python had a very easily distinguishable ClientHello and only used HTTP1.1. In order for us to complete this final step in solving the security system, we developed our own requests library in Golang using the uTLS package to customize our ClientHello and HTTP version. We then created a python wrapper to make integrating our requests library to our data generation program very simple.</p>
              <p>In the end, this was an extremely complicated project that taught me various of skills including networking, web development, and reverse engineering.</p>
