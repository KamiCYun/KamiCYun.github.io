            SpeakEZ is my own personal web security system inspired by various other systems including Akamai's Bot Manager, PerimeterX, Datadome, and Supreme's Ticket. It takes the best aspects from all of the systems and combines them into a much more secure version. SpeakEZ is comprised of three main components:
              <ul>
                <li>Browser Fingerprinting</li>
                <li>Mouse Movements</li>
                <li>Verification</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The browser fingerprinting will be fairly standard. Unfortunately there are not many improvements that can be made to the fingerprinting of existing systems. SpeakEZ collects user agents, browser dimensions, and a few more values to create a browser fingerprint for each user. This fingerprint is then stored in a short term memory to be referenced when the same user POSTs more data.</p>
              <p>Mouse movements are collected in a somewhat similar way to other security systems. It uses event listeners and a custom callback function to store 100 consecutive mouse coordinates and timestamps to create one large curve and the speed at which the cursor moved along it.</p>
              <p>The final step is to create an API responsible for classifying data as either a human or bot. The process of classifying browser fingerprints is as simple as referencing a database of fingerprints. However, validating mouse movements is significantly more difficult. The approach I took to this was to create a classification neural network. I created a chrome extension that could harvest mouse movements in the browser and collected thousands of human mouse movements. I then made a few algorithms to generate bot movements, among these algorithms was the bezier curve. After that, I normalized the starting coordinates of every curve to (0,0) and created a group of copies, each rotated by an increment of 90 degrees. Finally, I trained the neural network using each dataset as their respected classifications and produced a model that was 93% accurate in distinguishing between humans and bots.</p>
