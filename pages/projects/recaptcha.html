            Google's Recaptcha is a puzzle used by websites and applications to prevent bots from automating various proccess. Recaptcha V2 is the popular "I'm Not A Robot" checkbox that renders a series of photos and requires the user to select the photos corresponding to a prompt. Recaptcha V3 is an invisible puzzle that takes its parameters from aspects of the browser it is rendered on. There is no visual puzzle, Recaptcha V3 gathers information in the background and generates a trust score.
              <p>The first step of this project was rendering a browser. Recaptcha V2/V3 requires site owners to input their website's domain and are given an API key as well. Finding the API key was as simple as looking through javascript files on a given website, loading the captcha under a spoofed URL was not as simple. I used an electrion browser and the onRequest event listener to intercept our browser's request to a website before it was finished and inject my own HTML and Javascript in the response. This allowed for me to load my own version of the website more tailored to my needs while still having the correct URL.</p>
              <p>The next step was to harvest the recaptcha token on a successful solve. This was similar to the previous step and involved the same event listener. This time, rather than injecting our own code in the response, we simply read the response body and parsed the success token from it. This token was then POSTed to a local API responsible for managing the tokens and the expiration times. After finishing this, I had a functional method of harvesting Recaptcha tokens, however, the recaptcha puzzles were often harder than that on a normal browser. I realized this was because it was extremely obvious my electron browser was being automated. In response, I made some basic modifications to the browser somewhat masking its identity and added a feature to change the browser's IP through HTTP proxies as well as login to GMAIL accounts.</p>
